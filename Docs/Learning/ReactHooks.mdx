# React Hooks


## useMemo
 This hook is used to cache slow functions, functions that take a lot of time (programatically) to compute
 

 ### Properties
 - It takes a function and a list of dependencies
 - It has another use case called referential equality.
 Check out what referntial equality is [here]()
 

 ### Description
  It can be used to cache functions in component that are computationally expensive, when there are multiple renders of the component. 
  You could cache functions that are unrelated to the functions itself.
 

 ### Caveats
 - Has a performance Overlaod, It takes up memory so use it wisely.
 - It is triggerd only when it's dependencies change


## useCallback

This hook is similar to useMemo
The difference is that useMemo returns the value of the function, while useCallback returns the function itself.
Therefore any function that is assigned to a variable using useCallback can be used as a function.


## useEffect

The code inside the useEffect hook only runs only between renders of the component, provided the dependencies are changed
Anytime a side effect is performed useEffect is used

### Properties
- It takes a function and a list of dependencies'
- If no dependencies are provided, the code inisde the useEffect only runs onMount

Clean up function?
it should return a clean up function with cleanup logic, to disconnect from the system
The return code runs before hand the setup code runs

The return code is also called anytime the component unmounts
